Step 3: Create Your Website Files

Objective: To create the actual content and structure of your landing page and survey.

    You'll need at least an HTML file for your website. Optionally, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. For simplicity, start with HTML.
    If you're not familiar with HTML, you can find many templates online or start with a basic structure. Your HTML file must contain form elements for your survey (like input fields, radio buttons, checkboxes).
    Save your HTML file as index.html. This will be the main page of your website.

Step 4: Upload Your Website Files to GitHub

Objective: To get your website files onto GitHub, so they can be hosted by GitHub Pages.

    Go to your repository on GitHub.
    Click on "Add file" > "Upload files". Drag and drop your website files (e.g., index.html, any CSS or JavaScript files) into the browser window, then commit the changes.

Step 5: Enable GitHub Pages

Objective: To make your website accessible on the web.

    In your repository, go to "Settings" > "Pages" (you might need to scroll down or look under a "More" tab).
    Under "Source", select the branch where you uploaded your files (usually main or master) and click "Save".
    GitHub will provide you with a URL where your site is published. It might take a few minutes for your site to be accessible.

Step 6: Test Your Website

Objective: To ensure everything is working as expected.

    Visit the URL provided by GitHub Pages to see your website live.
    Test the survey by filling it out and checking if any linked functionalities (like form submission) work correctly.

Step 7: Collecting Survey Responses

Objective: To store or manage the responses from your survey.

    Since GitHub Pages hosts static sites, you cannot directly store responses there. Instead, you can use a third-party service (like Google Forms, Typeform, or a serverless function connecting to a database) to collect responses. Embed this service into your survey page.
    For a beginner, Google Forms might be the easiest; create a form and embed it into your index.html using the provided embed code.

Additional Notes

    Learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript basics if you're not familiar with them. These are essential for web development.
    Explore GitHub's documentation and community forums for more in-depth guides and troubleshooting.
    Consider privacy and data protection laws (like GDPR) when collecting information through surveys.
